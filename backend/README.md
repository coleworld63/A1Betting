- **feature_engineering.py**: Feature extraction, transformation, selection, and engineering logic for ML models.
- **feature_flags.py**: Feature flag and experiment management system.
- **feature_logger.py**: Logging utility for feature processing and pipeline events.
- **feature_monitor.py**: Tracks feature processing metrics and performance.
- **feature_registry.py**: Registry for feature configurations and metadata.
- **feature_selector.py**: Feature selection logic for ML pipelines.
- **feature_transformation.py**: Feature transformation and normalization utilities.
- **feature_validator.py**: Validates feature data for completeness and correctness.
- **filtered_prediction_api.py**: FastAPI router for filtered prediction endpoints.
- **main.py**: Main FastAPI application entrypoint, service initialization, and API registration.
- **monitoring_service.py**: Service for monitoring backend performance and generating alerts.
- **prediction_engine.py**: Unified prediction engine with ensemble, SHAP explainability, and API endpoints.
